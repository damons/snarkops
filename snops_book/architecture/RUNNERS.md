# Runners

A runner is a `snarkos` node runner. Of which we have two different ways.

## Snarkos

The regular `snarkos` installation and runner.

## Snarkos AoT

Our own custom wrapper around `snarkos` that allows for some custom behaviors:

- Additional logging setup/Changes
- Custom Ports
- Ahead-of-Time(AoT) Generation of public transactions
- Custom Genesis Creation
- Ledger Manipulation and viewing tools
