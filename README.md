  SNOPS
</h1>

This repository is home to the `snops` (snarkOS operations) ecosystem, and
`snarkos-aot`, a crate for performing ahead-of-time ledger actions.

snops is a suite of tools that can be used to maintain [Aleo](https://aleo.org/)
network environments. The environments are defined in a manner similar to
infrastructure-as-code, which means you can create repeatable infrastructure
using the environment schema.

This can be used to create devnets, simulate events on the network like outages
and attacks, and guarantee metrics.

To learn more about `snops` we recommend checking out the mdbook [here](todo).
